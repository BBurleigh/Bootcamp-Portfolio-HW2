        <p class = "float-left" class="boxing"> 
           The eldest of three boys, the first ten years of my life I grew up in a small cul-de-sac.  My family knew our neighbors very well, and my brothers and I spent so much time playing outside, watching TV, playing videogames, and having a very foreign and different childhood that kids today are missing.  We attended a Catholic private school for awhile, but since the principal secretly deemed me unfit to walk its halls, my parents learned later that this was a bad environment for me and my brothers.

           A Richmond native, I graduated from Midlothian High School in 2011 and competed in cross-country and track at Virginia Tech and then Shippensburg University.  My collegiate racing accolades are as follow: all-ACC for cross-country in 2012, PSAC champion in the indoor 3k in 2015, D2 Indoor Track National Champion in the mile in 2014, and all-academic honors for each year I competed.

        <p class="float-right" class="boxing">
           As the cost of living has been rising, teacher salaries floudered behind.  People outside of education look to public schools more as a complementary babysitting service that their taxes entitle them to.  And to compensate for the teacher shortage, instead of waging wages to where teacher pay would be competitive with a number of other jobs, counties pressure admin into combining classes, hiring unqualitified people to teach, as well as expecting teachers to refrain from disciplinary measures but somehow manage to impart knowledge to students who will do everything but learn... I could go on.  Really, I could.  But I'll stop with this.  Our culture and investment in education makes me sad.

           I enjoyed teaching.  I loved how public education can help nurture children's education.  I learned to be creative in how I handled students and their problems.  I liked having a stable schedule and a life after work.  However,
