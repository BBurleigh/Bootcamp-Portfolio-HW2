        <header>Breathing Steady: The Heart Rate Monitor App</header>

        <img src="./Assets/images/Heart Rate App Mockup.png" alt="Heart Rate Monitor" />

        <p>Knowing your limits and what your average heart rate is can help you train for a competition or simply get into better shape. However, regular heart rate monitors that wrap around your chest can be uncomfortable and look weird, while smartwatches are costly and consistently nag you when "you do not do enough activity". This app syncs with the health app on your smartdevice and more accurately measures your heart rate while resting or during activity.</p>
