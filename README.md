# Bootcamp-Portfolio-HW2

##Description

We were instructed to create a portfolio website to showcase our growing coding skills. There are sections where a user can see my avatar, a navigation bar, my WIPs, my bio, and an input form that one can use to contact me.

Installation
No installation needed. It can be accessed at __________________________________________________________________.

Usage
If someone was interested in looking at me for a potential coding job, either contractual/independent or with a company, then that person(s) can refer to this website.

Credits
Aside from my instructor and TA, I pulled bits of code and information from w3schools.com. In addition, I used some links to other websites in the WIP section (not actual projects; just to fulfill a grading requirement). But in the future, those links will be replaced by real project ones.

License
None.
