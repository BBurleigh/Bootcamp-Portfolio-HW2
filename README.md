# Bootcamp-Portfolio-HW2

##Description

We were instructed to create a portfolio website to showcase our growing coding skills. There are sections where a user can see my avatar and a navigation bar that will scroll them down the page to my projects/WIPs, mini bio, and a way to contact me through an input form. The other files that are labeled WIP.html, bio.html, and contact.html are not in use (disconnected from homepage html page for the requirements of the project).

##Installation

No installation needed. It can be accessed at __________________________________________________________________.

##Usage

If someone was interested in looking at me for a potential coding job, either contractual/independent or with a company, then that person(s) can refer to this website.

##Credits

Aside from my instructor and TA, I pulled bits of code and information from w3schools.com. In addition, I used some links to other websites in the WIP section (not actual projects; just to fulfill a grading requirement). But in the future, those links will be replaced by real project ones.

##License

None.
