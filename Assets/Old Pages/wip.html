        <h3>Virtual Novel: "Tales of a Society Agent"</h3>

        <p class="fix-WIP-format"><a href="https://twinery.org/"><img src="./Assets/images/HD-wallpaper-red-dragon-manzanedo-dragon-orange-red-art-fantasy.jpg" alt="Tales of a Society Agent" /></a></p>

        <p class="work-in-progress">Have you wished to be a member of an interdimensional society of field agents, workers, and people who desire to do their part in quelling the rifts between different worlds and people?  To have a chance to work with a group of diverse individuals, both human and nonhuman, to save a recently attacked witch's coven?  Immerse yourself in this realistic yet fantastic world as you, a novice Society agent, embark an elaborate mission to save the last witch from an infamous group of witch hunters.  Your choices matter, and multiple paths and endings exist in this virtual novel.  The demo chapter will be released in November 2022. </p>

        <h3>Retro Videogame: "Quest: The Primal Symphony"</h3>

        <p class="fix-WIP-format"><a href="https://www.emulatorgames.net/roms/gameboy-color/quest-rpg-brians-journey/"><img src="./Assets/images/Thumb_Quest_RPG_-_Brian-s_Journey_-_2000_-_Sunsoft.jpg" alt="Retro RPG Image" /></a></p>

        <p class="work-in-progress">Nostalgic and reminiscent of the 16-bit Gameboy Color games, you begin your journey as one of five characters: a human magician's apprentice, a homunculus servant, a feline merchant, a canine thief, or a cyclopian townguard.  During each character's prologue, the kingdom of Helka is attacked by an unknown cult of magic users.  Amid the chaos, your character discovers that they are a primal magician, one who can wield all four elements, and the only person who can save the world from the cult's ambitions. The demo file will be available on Steam and itch.io in January 2023.</p>

        <h3>Breathing Steady: The Heart Rate Monitor App</h3>

        <p class="fix-WIP-format"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Health-Fitness-AI-Lab-Accurate/dp/B07GQDRBWJ"><img src="./Assets/images/Heart Rate App Mockup.png" alt="Heart Rate Monitor" /></a></p>

        <p class="work-in-progress">Knowing your limits and what your average heart rate is can help you train for a competition or simply get into better shape. However, regular heart rate monitors that wrap around your chest can be uncomfortable and look weird, while smartwatches are costly and consistently nag you when "you do not do enough activity". This app syncs with the health app on your smartdevice and more accurately measures your heart rate while resting or during activity.</p>
